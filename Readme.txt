These files are my coding works.

The MATLAB codes are the core algorithm of damage detection in my published paper shown in my CV: A two-step method for delamination detection in composite laminates using experience-based learning algorithm.

There are two Python codes. One is a calculator that I used QT design and python, which is used to calculate the engineering materials usage in a project and the possible carbon emissions. Another is used to read and save the tested data of a Bluetooth-based wear micrometre. But the user interface and all the things are in Chinese....

I am an advanced beginner in C++. I have learned all the basic sytax in C++ and have just done several small projects followed the internet tutorial. The C++ coding is one of my practices using C++ in a real project.
